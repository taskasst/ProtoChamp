# ProtoChamp
An exergaming experience for college aged people stuck inside during the pandemic using an under-the-desk bike pedal and a webcam.

We are Team ProtoChamp, a cross-disciplinary team of students from Carnegie Mellon University studying at the Entertainment Technology Center.
We are on a discovery project for “exergaming”, which is about combining traditional exercise experiences with gaming technology. 

For this project we will start by taking a traditional exercise bike platform and explore new media experiences geared towards gamers.
To do this, we will purchase or create a custom hardware solution to obtain bike speed, resistance, directionality, and more.
This project will focus primarily on iterative content creation and designing engaging paradigms for exergaming.
